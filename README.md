# 🐦 Tweet Sentiment Analyzer

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that analyzes and predicts the sentiment of tweets.  
This project uses text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning/deep learning models to classify tweets into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** sentiment.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Clean and labeled tweet dataset  
- Text preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming/lemmatization, tokenization)  
- Feature engineering using:
  - Bag of Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF
  - Word Embeddings (optional)
- Machine learning model training  
- Text sentiment prediction script  
- Visualization of training metrics  
- Simple and user-friendly workflow

---

## 📊 Dataset
You can use:
- **Kaggle Tweet Sentiment dataset**, or  
- Any custom dataset in CSV format with columns like: Movie reviews

- Sentiment categories usually include:
- Positive  
- Negative  


---

## 🧠 Model(s) Used
Common ML/NLP models for sentiment prediction:
- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest  
- LSTM (optional)  
- BERT / Transformer-based models (optional)

Update this section with the exact model you used.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python *
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **NLTK / SpaCy**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (if using LSTM)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

📈 Results
- Model Accuracy: 73%
- it can be good more if we used a pre-trained model or hyperparameter tuning
